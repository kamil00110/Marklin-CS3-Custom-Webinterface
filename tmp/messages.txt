CS3 Terminal:
------------------
This part will only work when the CS3 is rooted with an Reverseshell script.
To do this press "root cs3" while an EMPTY corectly formated USB stick is in 
the CS3. Do this only at your own risk I do not take any responsibilitys for 
bricked CS3s, voided warantys and others. If you accepted the risks the script
can compile an custom update file (It can be edited and customized in the 
"payload" folder when the Server runs or Linux or Windows with corectly setuped
WSL (tested with Kali Distro) else a precompile Image will be used that is 
included in this build) and after that upload it to the CS3 and apply 
the update. Don't be scared and DON'T RESTART THE CS3!!! It will auto reboot to
the loginscreen and be stuck here for a longer time while installing the update
and auto reboting on it's own when finished. When succesfully connected this 
commandline will Show "conected XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX". When this dosnt happens then
try to restart the Website, restart the CS3 or making sure everything was 
setuped corectly.
